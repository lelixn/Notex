# 💤 Notex — The Coziest Note-Taking App on the Web

Yo nerds, I built **Notex 💤** — a beautifully simple notes app so cozy, even Snorlax woke up to try it.

🔗 **Try it live:** [notex-opal.vercel.app](https://notex-opal.vercel.app)

---

## ✨ Features

- 📝 Create and delete notes effortlessly  
- 💾 Auto-save (because clicking “Save” is exhausting)  
- 🗃️ All notes are stored securely in **your browser’s localStorage**  
- 🚀 Super fast — no loading, no backend, no waiting  
- 🎨 Clean, cute UI with Snorlax vibes  
- 📱 Fully responsive and mobile-friendly

---

## 🤯 No Backend? Yup.
> ☁️ No cloud.  
> 🖥️ No server.  
> 🗂️ Notex runs entirely on `localStorage` like it's 2010 — but cuter.

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **HTML + CSS + JavaScript**
- **LocalStorage** for data persistence
- **Vite** for lightning-fast dev/build
- **Snorlax** (not really, but emotionally)
